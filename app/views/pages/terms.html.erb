	<h4>6. The Smoothies</h4>
	<p><span>6.1.</span> The images of the Smoothies on the Website are for illustrative purposes only. The Smoothies may vary slightly from those images. The packaging of the Smoothies may also vary from that shown in images on the Website.<br></br>
	<span>6.2.</span> Any weights of the Smoothies are approximations only unless we state otherwise.<br></br>
	<span>6.3.</span> General advice, recipes and instructions relating to the Smoothies provided by Yoggie relating to the Smoothies have been produced in order to help you in using the Smoothies and to give guidance. These are provided for general information only. We accept no liability for any loss, damage or injury arising as a result of the advice, recipes or instructions provided to you on the Website or in conjunction with any of the Smoothies.<br></br>
	<span>6.4.</span> You are responsible for opening and inspecting the Smoothies upon delivery and then storing them correctly in the freezer. You are also completely responsible for the preparation and blending of the Smoothies. We accept no liability for any loss, damage or injury arising as a result of your incorrect storage or preparation of the Smoothies.<br></br>
	<span>6.5.</span> If you have an allergy, you are responsible for checking the Website to ensure that a Smoothie does not contain a relevant allergen to you. If you are not sure, please contact us. All of the packaging for the Smoothies is labelled to show any allergen advice, but please note that the Smoothies may contain allergens including cereals containing gluten (wheat, rye, barley and oats), crustaceans, eggs, fish, peanuts, soybeans, milk, lactose, nuts, celery, mustard, sesame, sulphur dioxide and sulphites, lupin and molluscs. All Smoothies are packed in a facility that handles nuts. Any severe allergy sufferers should contact us before placing an order.<br></br>
	<span>6.6.</span> If we are unable to supply you with a Smoothie, for example because we cannot meet your requested delivery date or because of an error in the price on the Website we will inform you by email and we will not process your order. If you have already paid for the Smoothies, we will refund you the full amount including any delivery costs charged as soon as reasonably practicable.<br></br>
	<span>6.7.</span> We will try our best to supply exactly what you have ordered, including the correct type and weight of ingredient, but we reserve the right to substitute such ingredients that we may not be able to practically and reasonably obtain with similar ingredients. If you are not happy with any substitution, please contact us in accordance with paragraph 18 below. We will not charge you for incorrect Smoothies (Smoothies that you have not ordered and substitutes for those Smoothies which are not acceptable to you)<br></br>
	<span>6.8.</span> We like to tell you which suppliers we are using as we think they are some of the best. However, we reserve the right to change suppliers at any time and without notification, particularly if there are supply and delivery issues or shortages.
	</p>


	<h4>7. How the Contract is formed between you and us</h4>
	<p><span>7.1.</span> Please take time to read and check your order at each page of the order process. After placing an order for the Smoothies, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Smoothie. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that the Smoothie has been dispatched ("Order Sent Confirmation"). The contract between us for the purchase of the Smoothies ("Contract") will only be formed when we send you the Order Sent Confirmation. We are not under any obligation to accept an order from you.<br></br>
	<span>7.2.</span> The Contract will relate only to those Smoothies whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Order Sent Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Smoothies which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Smoothies has been confirmed in a separate Order Sent Confirmation.
	</p>


	<h4>8. Cancellation</h4>
	<p><span>8.1.</span> Please take time to read and check your order at each page of the order process. After placing an order for the Smoothies, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Smoothie. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that the Smoothie has been dispatched ("Order Sent Confirmation"). The contract between us for the purchase of the Smoothies ("Contract") will only be formed when we send you the Order Sent Confirmation. We are not under any obligation to accept an order from you.<br></br>
	<span>8.2.</span> The Contract will relate only to those Smoothies whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Order Sent Confirmation.

	</p>


	<h4>9. Returns & refunds</h4>
	<p><span>9.1.</span> As the Smoothies contain perishable food, you are not entitled to the "normal" right to return goods within 14 days after the day you receive them simply if you change your mind. This is because the food is likely to have a best before date within only a few days of delivery of the Smoothies.<br></br>
	<span>9.2.</span> Subject to these Terms you have the right of return and refund if the Smoothie is defective or not as described.<br></br>
	<span>9.3.</span> As you are a consumer we are under a legal duty to supply Smoothies that are in conformity with this Contract. You have legal rights in relation to Smoothies that are defective or not as described. If the Smoothies we deliver to you are defective or are not as described on the Website, you should contact us and report such defect or misdescription as soon as possible (we ask that this is within 3 days from delivery of the Smoothies and if possible we ask that you send us a photograph as evidence of the defective or misdescribed Smoothie – this will assist in processing your refund quickly).<br></br>
	<span>9.4.</span> We will ask you to safely dispose of any such Smoothie and if we agree that it is defective or misdescribed (acting reasonably) we will offer you the choice of either an exchange or a refund of the price of the Smoothie in full.<br></br>
	<span>9.5.</span> We will refund you within 14 days after the day on which (whichever is the earlier of):
		<ul>
			<li><span>9.5.1.</span> the day we receive the Smoothie back from you;</li>
			<li><span>9.5.2.</span> the day on which you provide us with acceptable evidence that you have sent the Smoothie back to us; or</li>
			<li><span>9.5.3.</span> the day on which you provide us with acceptable evidence that the Smoothie is defective or misdescribed and we have agreed for you to throw the Smoothie away safely.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p><span>9.6.</span> We try our best to ensure that the Smoothies are perfect every time but we are sure you will agree that this is not always possible. In the event of a minor error (for example, failing to include one ingredient which is not the main ingredient, or substituting a green grape for a red grape) we reserve the right to use our discretion as to whether a full refund is applicable or not. We will act reasonably 
	<span>9.7.</span> and may offer you a partial refund or a voucher.<br></br>
	We will refund you by the method used by you to pay.<br></br>
	<span>9.8.</span><u>Your legal rights:</u> Advice about your legal right to cancel the Contract is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office. Your legal rights are not affected by your right of return and refund in this paragraph or anything else in these Terms.<br></br>
	<span>9.9.</span> <u>How to contact us:</u> email <%= link_to "everyone@yoggie.co.uk", "mailto:everyone@yoggie.co.uk" %> or call 020 3627 3852.
	</p>


	<h4>10. Delivery</h4>
	<p><span>10.1.</span> We will confirm if we can deliver to you and if we can your estimated delivery date, in the Order Sent Confirmation.<br></br>
	<span>10.2.</span> If you order a Smoothie before midnight on a Thursday, we will deliver your Smoothie that Sunday or Monday (i.e. in 4 to 5 days' time) and if you order a Smoothie after midnight on a Thursday it will be delivered to you the following Sunday or Monday (i.e. in 10 or 11 days' time), unless there are exceptional circumstances, for example, if delivery is affected by an Event Outside Our Control (see paragraph 20 for our responsibilities). Please note that delivery dates are estimates only.<br></br>
	<span>10.3.</span> It is your responsibility to ensure that you have given us the correct delivery address and any special delivery instructions.<br></br>
	<span>10.4.</span> We will leave the Smoothies in your nominated safe place between 0001 and 0700 on the delivery date.<br></br>
	<span>10.5.</span> It is your responsibility to ensure the nominated safe place is accessible and safe for us to drop off the Smoothies. Our driver may leave the Smoothies in another place he/she deems safe. If we have done so or left them in the nominated safe place and they are stolen or damaged we do not accept any liability but may offer you a refund or other compensation at our complete discretion.
	</p>

	<h4>11. Risk and title</h4>
	<p><span>11.1. </span>The Smoothies will be at your risk on completion of delivery.<br></br>
	<span>11.2. </span>Ownership of the Smoothies will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Smoothies, including any delivery charges.</p>
	
	<h4>12. Price and payment</h4>
	<p><span>12.1. </span>The price of the Smoothies and any delivery charges will be as quoted on the Website from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Smoothie prices include VAT.<br></br>
	<span>12.2. </span>Smoothie prices and any delivery charges are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Order Sent Confirmation.<br></br>
	<span>12.3. </span>The Website contains a large number of Smoothies and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Smoothies listed on the Website may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Smoothie's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Smoothie to you. If a Smoothie’s correct price is higher than the price stated on the Website, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Smoothie, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.<br></br>
	<span>12.4. </span>We are under no obligation to provide the Smoothie to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an Order Sent Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as an error.<br></br>
	<span>12.5. </span>Payment for all Smoothies must be by credit or debit card and we require payment before we despatch the Smoothies. We use the payment services of Stripe.com and PayPal UK to carry out and process your payments.</p>

	<h4>13. Discount codes and gift cards</h4>
	<p><span>13.1. </span>You may use a discount code if it has been issued or authorised by us for the Smoothies. You are only be able to use them once per household.<br></br>
	<span>13.2. </span>Discount codes and gift cards may only be applied to future orders and cannot be exchanged or refunded for cash. Please check if there are time limits to the discount codes and gift cards as you may only have a limited period to use them. No change or credit will be given for unused portions of a gift card.<br></br>
	<span>13.3. </span>We may apply maximum limits to the value of gift cards and the amount you can claim a discount code on.<br></br>
	<span>13.4. </span>We reserve the right to cancel discount codes at any time. We also reserve the right to reject discount codes and gift cards if we suspect any fraud.<br></br>
	<span>13.5. </span>We will not accept liability if discount codes or gift cards are lost, stolen or damaged.</p>

	<h4>14. Warranty (our promises)</h4>
	<p><span>14.1. </span>Subject to the disclaimers set out in paragraph 15 we promise to you that any Smoothie purchased from us through the Website will conform in all material respects with its description, be of satisfactory quality, be reasonably fit for all the purposes for which Smoothies of that kind are commonly supplied at the time of delivery.<br></br>
	<span>14.2. </span>The Smoothies we sell have been designed and prepared to comply with the statutory legal requirements and relevant health and safety standards of the United Kingdom. We can therefore make no representation or warranty that any Smoothie is compliant with health, safety or other legal requirements which apply outside the United Kingdom, unless delivery is within the EEA and common EEA Consumer Protection and Safety rules apply.<br></br>
	<span>14.3. </span>We shall have no liability under the warranty set out at paragraph 15.1 to the extent that any damage or defect results from:

			<li><span>14.3.4.</span> any failure to use reasonable skill and care in using, consuming, blending or otherwise preparing the Smoothies and/or failure to use the Smoothies legally and/or for the purposes for which they are intended to be used.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h4>15. Our liability</h4>
	<p><span>15.1. </span>Nothing in these Terms shall:
		<ul>
			<li><span>15.1.1</span> restrict your statutory rights (including your rights to receive a reasonable standard of service, more details about which can be obtained from your local Trading Standards office or Citizen's Advice Bureau);</li>

		</ul>
	</p>
Subject to paragraph 15.1, if we fail to comply with these Terms, we shall only be liable to you for the purchase price of the Smoothies and, subject to paragraph 15.3, any losses that you suffer as a result of our failure to comply (whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise) which are a foreseeable consequence of such failure. We are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable at the time we enter into a Contract.
Subject to paragraph 15.1, we will not be liable for losses that result from our failure to comply with these Terms that fall into the following categories: loss of income or revenue; loss of business; loss of profits; loss of anticipated savings; loss or corruption of data, information or software; or waste of management or office time. However, this paragraph will not prevent claims for loss of or damage to your tangible property that are foreseeable or any other claims for direct loss that are not excluded in this paragraph.

Events outside our control
We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under a Contract that is caused by events outside our reasonable control ("Event Outside Our Control").

Waiver
If we fail, at any time during the term of a Contract, to insist upon strict performance of any of your obligations under the Contract or any of these Terms, or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies to which we are entitled under the Contract, this will not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies and will not relieve you from compliance with such obligations.
A waiver by us of any default will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default.
No waiver by us of any of these Terms will be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is communicated to you in writing in accordance with paragraph 17 above.

Contracts for the purchase of Smoothies through the Website and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them will be governed by English law. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with such Contracts will be subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England.
